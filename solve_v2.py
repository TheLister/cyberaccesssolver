#define the matrix as an ordered list (should I use dictonary)

#define the Datamine sequences as lists of strings

# find all matrix indices where the first string of any of the wanted sequence matches the top row

# add all indices where the first requested sequence is anywhere in the matrix 


# if we are not able to use the first buffer in the best way, then we will revert to wasting the first buffer in order to get the best possible result
